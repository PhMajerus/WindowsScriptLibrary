# Windows Script Library
Functions that can be used in Windows Scripts (WSH, HTA, classic ASP,â€¦)

This is a repository of functions that are convenient when doing shell scripting in Windows using the Windows Script Host or another script host using the JScript and VBScript languages.

They can be copied in Windows Script Host (WSH) .js or .vbs files, in script blocks within .wsf files, as well as script blocks within Windows Script Component (WSC) .wsc/.sct files, or HTA (HTML Application) .hta files.
